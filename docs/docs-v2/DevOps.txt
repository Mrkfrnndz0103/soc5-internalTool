DevOps view focused on stability, speed, and zero-downtime
Core DevOps Pillars (With Tools)

1. Version Control (Mandatory)
Tracks and protects code.

Tool:
    - Git (GitHub)
Rules:
    - No direct production changes
    - Use branches
    - Code review before merge

2. CI (Continuous Integration)
Catches bugs before deployment.

Tools:
    - GitHub Actions
What runs automatically:
    - Tests
    - Linting
    - Build checks
This prevents broken code from reaching production.

3. CD (Continuous Deployment)
Deploy safely and repeatably.

Tools:
    - GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Best practices:
    - Zero-downtime deployment
    - Automatic rollback on failure

4. Containers (Consistency)
Ensures the app runs the same everywhere.

Tools:
    - Docker

Benefits:
    - Same environment locally and in production
    - Easy scaling
    - Resource isolation

5. Infrastructure as Code (Stability)
Servers are code, not manual work.

Tools:
    - Terraform
Benefits:
    - Reproducible infrastructure
    - Easy recovery
    - No configuration drift

6. Performance & Load Handling
Prevents lag under traffic.

Tools:
    - Nginx (reverse proxy)
    - Load balancers
    - Auto-scaling (cloud)

7. Monitoring & Alerting
Detect problems before users complain.

Tools:
    - Prometheus + Grafana
Track:
    - Response time
    - Error rates
    - CPU / memory
    - Database performance

8. Logging & Error Tracking
Debug fast.

Tools: 
    - Sentry

9. Security & Reliability
Protect uptime.

Tools:
    - HTTPS (TLS)
    - Secrets Manager
    - Rate limiting
    - Vulnerability scanning (Dependabot, Trivy)
