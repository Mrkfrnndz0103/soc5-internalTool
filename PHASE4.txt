Phase 4 — Hardening (prevents future bugs)

1. Request schema validation
    - Add Zod (or similar) on every POST/PATCH.
2. Rate limiting (cheap)
    - Basic per-session rate limit in DB (no Redis). Store counters with TTL if needed.
3. Session refresh load
    - getSession() updates last_seen_at periodically. OK, but ensure it doesn’t run on every single asset call (keep it API-only).
